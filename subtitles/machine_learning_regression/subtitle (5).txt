[MUSIC] Okay, so for the first part
of our course on regression, we're gonna start with something
that's called simple regression. And as the name implies, it's just
a very simple form of regression, where we assume that we
just have one input. And we're just trying to fit a line. Okay, but before we get to starting to
talk about this simple regression model, let's just recall our task of interest. Where our case study is discussing
how to predict house prices. So in particular,
we have some house that we wanna list for sale, but
we don't the value of this house. And as we discussed at fairly great length
in the first course of the specialization, what we're going to do in this case, is we're going to look at other
houses that sold in the recent past. And look at how much they've sold and
different characteristics of those houses, and use that data to inform
our listing price for our house that we'd like to sell. [MUSIC]
